Measure installs
================

The AwesomeAds SDK contains a submodule that allows you to measure installs generated by CPI (Cost per Install) campaigns.

The submodule is already integrated in the main SDK but you can also install it as a standalone dependency, if you're an advertiser and just want to
measure installs without necessarily displaying ads.

Using Gradle, include the following Maven repository in your module's **build.gradle** file (usually the file under MyApplication/app/):

.. code-block:: shell

    repositories {
        maven {
            url  'http://dl.bintray.com/gabrielcoman/maven'
        }
    }

Then add the following dependency to your project:

.. code-block:: shell

    dependencies {
        compile 'tv.superawesome.lib.sacpi:sacpi:1.0.+'
    }

Once you've integrated the SDK or CPI submodule you'll need to call the **handleInstall** method, preferably
in the first activity presented to the user.

.. code-block:: java

    SACPI.getInstance().handleInstall(this, new SACPIInterface() {
      @Override
      public void saDidCountAnInstall(boolean success) {
        // handle callback
      }
    });

The method will only run once per application lifecycle, usually when the application is first installed on a user's phone.

It also contains a simple callback with a boolean **success** parameter that lets you know if AwesomeAds considered this
install as having been generated by a CPI campaign.

.. warning:: Please be aware that not implementing this method at all will mean you won't be able to measure installs coming from
             AwesomeAds CPI campaigns, at all.
